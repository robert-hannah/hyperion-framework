# hyperion-framework

A lightweight component-based TCP framework for building service-oriented Rust applications with CLI control, async messaging, and lifecycle management.

## Quickfire Features

- üîå **Component-Based Architecture**: Build modular systems with loosely coupled components
- üåê **TCP Communication**: Built-in networking support for distributed systems
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Handling**: Built in unique config and network topology handling for each component
- üíª **CLI Integration**: Command-line interface for system control and monitoring
- üîÑ **State Management**: Robust component state handling and lifecycle management
- üì¶ **Containerisation**: Simplified component containment and management
- üöÄ **Async Support**: Built on tokio for high-performance async operations

## Hyperion Overview
Hyperion is designed around a component-based architecture, allowing you to create modular services that communicate over TCP. Each component is encapsulated in a `HyperionContainer`, which manages its lifecycle, configuration, and state.

Each component becomes a self-contained, event-driven service that:

    Listens and responds to structured TCP messages

    Exposes a CLI for control and inspection

    Handles its own config parsing, logging, and lifecycle state (start/restart/shutdown)

Hyperion is ideal for service-oriented projects where you want clean separation of logic, real-time communication, and 
container-like encapsulation within native Rust programs. 

The framework makes it simple to bring your project into a fully asynchronous and multithreaded service-based environment, enabling independent component development, easier debugging, and scalability.

Hyperion is also built on top of the Tokio async runtime, enabling high-performance, non-blocking operations.
